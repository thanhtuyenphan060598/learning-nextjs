# Product Context: Learning Next.js Blog

## Why This Project Exists

This project serves as a structured learning environment for mastering Next.js development. It addresses the need for:

- **Structured Learning Path**: A clear 6-week progression through Next.js concepts
- **Documentation**: Capturing insights and learnings for future reference
- **Practical Application**: Learning by building a real, functional application
- **Vietnamese Resources**: Creating learning content in Vietnamese for better comprehension

## Problems It Solves

1. **Lack of Structured Learning**: Many tutorials are scattered; this provides a cohesive journey
2. **Language Barrier**: Vietnamese content makes learning more accessible
3. **Theory vs Practice Gap**: Combines conceptual learning with hands-on implementation
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress tracking through completed blog posts
