# Active Context: Learning Next.js Blog

## Current Focus: Day 3 - Components và Layouts

### What We're Working On Right Now

- **Build Issue**: Windows permission error with `.next/trace` file during production builds
- **Learning Progression**: Moving from basic routing to components and layouts
- **Documentation**: Setting up Memory Bank system for better project tracking

### Recent Changes & Discoveries

1. **Build System**: Project builds successfully but fails at the end with permission error
2. **Content Structure**: All 3 blog posts are well-structured with Vietnamese content
3. **Architecture**: Clean App Router implementation with proper file organization

### Current Technical State

- **Development**: Works perfectly with `yarn dev`
- **Production Build**: Completes but fails with trace file permission error
- **Content**: 2 completed blog posts, 1 upcoming (Day 3)
- **Features**: Dynamic routing, loading states, and error handling implemented

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix Build Error**: Address Windows permission issue preventing successful builds
2. **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation setup for future development sessions
3. **Learning Continuity**: Prepare for Day 3 content creation

### Technical Decisions Being Made

- **Build Tool**: Continue using Turbopack despite minor permission issues
- **Documentation**: Implement comprehensive Memory Bank system
- **Project Structure**: Maintain current clean architecture

### Learning Path Progress

- ✅ **Day 1**: Project setup and basic structure - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Day 2**: Dynamic routing and loading states - COMPLETED
- ⏳ **Day 3**: Components and layouts - IN PROGRESS
- ⏳ **Day 4-6**: Advanced topics - UPCOMING

## Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

1. Resolve `.next/trace` permission error for clean builds
2. Complete Memory Bank documentation setup
3. Create `.cursor/rules` file for project intelligence
4. Prepare for Day 3 learning content about components and layouts

## Context for Future Sessions

- This is a Vietnamese learning project documenting Next.js mastery
- Build system works but has Windows-specific permission issues
- Content is well-structured with clear progression
- Memory Bank system is being established for session continuity
- Focus should remain on learning objectives while maintaining clean architecture
